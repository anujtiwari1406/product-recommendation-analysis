Product Recommendation Analysis
🔹 Project Overview
This project aims to derive meaningful customer insights from product reviews by employing sentiment analysis and data visualization.
Using Python (with NLTK, TextBlob, Plotly, and Tkinter), we:

Gather reviews from Flipkart

Perform extensive text processing

Identify customer sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) for each product’s key features

Provide visually rich pie charts and graphs for data storytelling

🔹 Visualizations
Vertical Bar Chart — Each vertical bar represents a sum value of a specific metric across different product categories.

🔹 What It Is Comparing:
It is comparing the sum of various product-related metrics by category. Specifically, the chart visualizes:

Sum of actual price

Sum of discount percentage

Sum of discounted price

Sum of rating

Sum of rating count

Each of these metrics is aggregated for different product categories such as:

Computers

Car & Motorbike accessories

Electronics, etc.

🔹 Purpose:
To visually compare how different categories perform across key sales and review metrics — helping identify which categories have higher prices, more discounts, better ratings, or higher volume of reviews.

Features:

Clear color-coding (green for positive, red for negative).

Legends and annotations to aid understanding.

PNG files are exported directly alongside the script for easy sharing.



🔹 Data Story
This project guides you through understanding customer satisfaction and pain points with products:

✅ Identify frequently liked or disliked aspects.
