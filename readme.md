Product Recommendation Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project aims to derive meaningful customer insights from product reviews by employing sentiment analysis and data visualization.
Using Python (with NLTK, TextBlob, Plotly, and Tkinter), we:

â€¢	Gather reviews from Flipkart

â€¢	Perform extensive text processing

â€¢	Identify customer sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) for each productâ€™s key features

â€¢	Provide visually rich pie charts and graphs for data storytelling

ðŸ”¹ Visualizations
Vertical Bar Chart â€” Each vertical bar represents a sum value of a specific metric across different product categories.

ðŸ”¹ What It Is Comparing:
It is comparing the sum of various product-related metrics by category. Specifically, the chart visualizes:

â€¢	Sum of actual price

â€¢	Sum of discount percentage

â€¢	Sum of discounted price

â€¢	Sum of rating

â€¢	Sum of rating count

Each of these metrics is aggregated for different product categories such as:

â€¢	Computers

â€¢	Car & Motorbike accessories

â€¢	Electronics, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose:
To visually compare how different categories perform across key sales and review metrics â€” helping identify which categories have higher prices, more discounts, better ratings, or higher volume of reviews.

Features:

Clear color-coding (green for positive, red for negative).

Legends and annotations to aid understanding.

PNG files are exported directly alongside the script for easy sharing.
